                <h2>The Story</h2>
                <p>The idea is you're in a large underground animation studio and Bendy is trying to get you with more and more evil to come. You, the main character (who is called Henry) try to get out but just keep going deeper and deeper in to the studio.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <img src="./cutout.jpg" alt="arg" width="175" height="175">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
                <p>
                    The studio was run by Joey Drew which was funny because the studio made animations which were the Bendy cartoons which started Bendy, Boris and Alice Angel but sometimes had the Butcher gang. The studio started to lose money and they needed something that would change the business forever.
                    So they started making a themepark called "Bendy Land" but the fake costumes looked too fake for Joey Drew. So Joey teamed up with GENT to make the Ink Machine! They made it so you put ink in and chose what you want it to make but there was one problem they had.
                    You see the ink didn't just stay in a shape it had to have a body and a human one too. So some people wanted to do it and other didn't have a choice. Then the first test happened to make Bendy but he came out distorted and uncanny so Joey locked him up and left him with cartoon videos but then he got out.
